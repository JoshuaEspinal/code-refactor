# code-refactor

## Description

I built this project to refactor the original code in the index.
Refactoring the original code can help other developers easily read the code and refactoring is more efficient.
While I was working on this project I learned all the HTML semantic elements and what they describe.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To see the refactored code open up the webpage and proceed to open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).
A console panel will open up on the side and reveal the refactored code.
